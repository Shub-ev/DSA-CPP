// C++ is a compiled language.
// For a program to run, its source text has to be processed by a compiler, producing object files
// which are combined by a linker yielding an executable program
// A C++ program typically consists of many source code files (usually simply called source files).

// each C++ program must have main() or we will get error:
    // undefined reference to `WinMain@16'
